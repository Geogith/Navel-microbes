The plot.ly homework involved several hours and days working on this code.  Understanding D3 library for reading a json file was quite intense. Loading in and organizing the data and code was the most difficult part of this homework. Using live server (instead of opening in default browser) and console.log proved to be invaluable in modifying and understanding the code as it was being written. This was an exercise in iterating over and over again as you reviewed your code for errors and understand the order in which the code had to be written for it to work.
The most important part of the homework was learning the sequence of how the code needed to be written in order for it to work.
